            <p>I do a lot of things. This little space on the web exists to describe a few of them</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li />By day, I work at Red Hat where I help manage Opensource.com. It's a little bit of writing, a little bit of editing, a little bit of research, a little bit of site maintenance, a little bit of analytics, and a little bit of hundreds of other things. I love it. If you're interested in open source, you should probably drop me a line sometime.
			<li />By evenings, I do a lot of work around local government policy, particularly land use, transportation, and open government issues. I've had a number of volunteer roles helping Chapel Hill and Orange County, NC with these issues, and I've been involved in a good number of political issues there as well. I also serve as the technical editor for OrangePolitics.org.
			<li />By, umm, other evenings and a lot of weekends, I'm a tinkerer. I like to play with data analysis, visualization, hobbyist electronics, digital mapping, and various open source tools across the full stack, top to bottom. I'm trying to get in the habit of writing about those things more often, in case anyone else finds them interesting.
